<h2>Number of Swimming Pools Needed</h2>
<p>
There is a popular myth about the man who invented chess. The local ruler was so pleased with the
invention that he offered the inventor a great reward in gold. The inventor suggested an alternative
reward: he would get one
grain of wheat on the first square of the chess board, two grains on the
second square, fourth on the third, eight on the fourth, etc., doubling the number of grains each time.
The ruler saw that this must be a much better deal for him, and he accepted.
The board has 64 squares
